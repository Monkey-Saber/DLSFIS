# DLSFIS
There are some caveats to running this code:1、DLSFIS is an integrated multi-omics clustering framework that relies on autoencoders and self-expression learning.Users should apply min–max or z-score normalization to each omics dataset.2、High-dimensional omics data should be filtered before training.Since DLSFIS employs autoencoders and a self-expression layer to model subspace structures, excessively high feature dimensions greatly increase computational cost.3、The example files included with the code provide only a dataset.If you need to demonstrate results on other datasets, please manually change the paths and retrain the model with the corresponding data.4、Finally.The omics matrices can then be used to train the AE module, self-expression module, fusion module, and integrated self-supervision module, ultimately producing the refined affinity matrix and the final subtype labels to obtain accurate results.
# enrich_BIC
1、The clinical-enrichment module implemented in enrich_BIC.py is used after the DLSFIS framework generates final subtype labels. Its purpose is to evaluate whether the identified subtypes are significantly associated with clinical variables. By performing chi-square tests on pathologic T/N/M stage, overall stage, and other categorical features, this module helps verify the clinical relevance of the subspace-fused clustering results produced by DLSFIS.2、This module is designed to work in conjunction with DLSFIS. After DLSFIS outputs the final cluster labels, users should merge these labels with the clinical table and run enrich_BIC.py to obtain the statistical significance (p-values) of clinical feature enrichment across subtypes. The code, required datasets, and demonstration usage are all provided in the corresponding script.
